#   Create a new file called hello_world.py
#   Edit your new file (preferably using VIM) so that the first line prints out the string 'Hello World!'
#   On the second line of your script, create your first variable called name and assign it the value of your first name
#   On the third line, use concatenation to print out the phrase 'My name is <NAME> and I will be a Python Master!' using the variable name in place of <NAME>
#   Using the python3 interpreter, run your new script!
